    title: Logs now can search server, and server displays properly!
    message: Added Dapper Micro ORM to map what the SQL query returns to a new class called WebAdminLog, thus fixing the server not being able to be displayed on the respective log. Also the server serach bar basically had no backend so I gave it the ablity to be used.
